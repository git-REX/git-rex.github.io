user_description: Aspiring Electrical Engineer with a passion for turning ideas into real, working systems. Currently working at NJM Group for AUSTRALIAN BOLLARDS, where I focus on control systems, software integration, fault detection and analysis, R&D and circuit design. I enjoy bridging the gap between hardware and software, and I'm always exploring better and smarter ways to build and improve electronic systems.
